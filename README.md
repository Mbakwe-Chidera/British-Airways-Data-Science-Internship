**Flight Review Sentiment Analysis Project**

In this project, I conducted web scraping on the Skytrax website to gather valuable insights from flight reviews. The extracted data was then utilized to perform sentiment analysis, shedding light on passengers' sentiments and experiences.

**Project Highlights:**

1. **Web Scraping:**
   - *Source:* Skytrax website
   - *Objective:* Extracting detailed information from flight reviews to gain a comprehensive understanding of customer experiences.

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - *Method:* Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis on the gathered reviews.
   - *Insights:* Derived actionable insights from the sentiment analysis to contribute to the enhancement of customer service.

3. **Customer Booking Behavior Prediction:**
   - *Analysis:* Employed machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict customer booking behavior.
   - *Objective:* Utilizing historical data to predict future booking patterns, aiding in strategic decision-making for improved customer engagement.

**Contributions and Learnings:**
- *Customer Service Improvement:* The sentiment analysis provided valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the airline's services, facilitating targeted improvements in customer service.
  
- *Predictive Analytics:* By predicting customer booking behavior, the project assists in anticipating market trends and adapting strategies to meet customer expectations.

**Next Steps:**
- Further refine sentiment analysis models to capture nuanced feedback.
- Explore additional features for customer booking behavior prediction to enhance predictive accuracy.

**Technologies Used:**
- Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup
- Sentiment Analysis: NLTK, TextBlob
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, RandomForest

**Conclusion:**
This project showcases the fusion of web scraping, sentiment analysis, and machine learning to extract meaningful insights from flight reviews. The outcomes contribute not only to enhancing customer service but also to making informed decisions regarding booking behavior. The journey continues as we refine models and explore new avenues for greater analytical depth.
